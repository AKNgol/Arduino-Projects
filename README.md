# Arduino-Projects

This repository contains my code and results from the Arduino Starter Kit Projects Book.

# Project 02: Spaceship Interface

This is the first project in the starter kit that utilizes digital input and output.
It involves making red LEDs blink when a button is pressed.

# Project 03: Love-O-Meter

This project involves utilizing analog input and the built-in serial monitor in the
Arduino IDE. Depending on the temperature perceived by a temperature sensor, one to
three LEDs will light up.

# Project 04: Color Mixing Lamp

This project involves mapping values from three phototransistors to values for a
tri-color LED. The lighting conditions that the three phototransistors perceive
dictate the color of the LED.

# Project 05: Mood Cue

This project involves mapping values from a potentiometer to usable values for a
servo motor. The potentiometer is used to change the position the servo motor is
set to.

# Project 06: Light Theremin

This project involves taking input values from a phototransistor and mapping them
to usable values for a piezo. The piezo will change its pitch based on the external
lighting conditions that the phototransistor perceives.

# Project 07: Keyboard

This project involves using switch buttons with the piezo to create a keyboard
instrument. Each button changes the pitch of the piezo.
